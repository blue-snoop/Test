            WHAT IS BRACKETS?
        -->
        <p>
            <em>Brackets is a different type of editor.</em>
            Brackets has some unique features like Quick Edit, Live Preview and others that you may not find in other
            editors. And Brackets is written in JavaScript, HTML and CSS. That means that most of you using Brackets
            have the skills necessary to modify and extend the editor. In fact, we use Brackets every day to build
            Brackets. To learn more about how to use the key features, read on.
